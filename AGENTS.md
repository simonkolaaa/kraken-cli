# Agent Integration Guide: kraken-cli

> **This is experimental software. Commands execute real financial transactions on the Kraken exchange. Test with `kraken paper` before using real funds. See [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md) for full terms.**

Self-contained guide for integrating `kraken-cli` into AI agents, MCP clients, and automated pipelines.

Fast entry points:
- Runtime agent context: `CONTEXT.md`
- Full command contract: `agents/tool-catalog.json`
- Error routing contract: `agents/error-catalog.json`
- Workflow skills: `skills/`

## Installation

Single binary, no runtime dependencies.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/krakenfx/kraken-cli/releases/latest/download/kraken-cli-installer.sh | sh
```

Pre-built binaries for macOS (Apple Silicon, Intel) and Linux (x86_64, ARM64) are also available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/krakenfx/kraken-cli/releases) page.

Verify: `kraken --version`

## Authentication

### Environment variables (recommended for agents)

```bash
export KRAKEN_API_KEY="your-key"
export KRAKEN_API_SECRET="your-secret"

# Futures (optional, separate credentials)
export KRAKEN_FUTURES_API_KEY="your-futures-key"
export KRAKEN_FUTURES_API_SECRET="your-futures-secret"
```

No config file needed. No interactive prompts. The CLI reads credentials from the environment.

### Credential resolution order

1. Command-line flags (`--api-key`, `--api-secret`)
2. Environment variables (`KRAKEN_API_KEY`, `KRAKEN_API_SECRET`)
3. Config file (`~/.config/kraken/config.toml`)

### Required permissions by command group

| Group | Kraken API permissions |
|-------|----------------------|
| market | None (public) |
| account | Query Funds, Query Open Orders & Trades, Query Closed Orders & Trades, Query Ledger Entries |
| trade | Create & Modify Orders, Cancel/Close Orders |
| funding | Deposit Funds, Withdraw Funds, Query Funds |
| earn | Query Funds, Create & Modify Orders |
| subaccount | Access & Modify Account Settings |
| websocket (public) | None |
| websocket (private) | Same as account + trade |
| paper | None (local simulation) |

## Invocation Pattern

Every command follows the same pattern:

```bash
kraken <command> [args...] -o json 2>/dev/null
```

Rules:
- Always pass `-o json` for structured output.
- Redirect stderr: `2>/dev/null` or `2>debug.log`.
- stdout contains only valid JSON (success) or a JSON error envelope (failure).
- Exit code 0 = success, non-zero = failure.

### Basic examples

```bash
# Public data (no auth)
kraken ticker BTCUSD -o json
kraken orderbook BTCUSD --count 10 -o json
kraken ohlc BTCUSD --interval 60 -o json

# Private data
kraken balance -o json
kraken open-orders -o json

# Trading
kraken order buy BTCUSD 0.001 --type limit --price 50000 -o json
kraken order cancel TXID123 -o json

# Paper trading (no auth)
kraken paper init --balance 10000 -o json
kraken paper buy BTCUSD 0.01 -o json
kraken paper status -o json
```

## Output Parsing

### Success response

stdout contains the API response as JSON. Structure varies by command.

```json
{"BTCUSD":{"a":["67234.10","1","1.000"],"b":["67234.00","1","1.000"]}}
```

### Error response

On non-zero exit, stdout contains a JSON error envelope:

```json
{"error": "auth", "message": "Authentication failed: EAPI:Invalid key"}
```

The `error` field is a stable category code. The `message` field is human-readable and not stable.

### WebSocket streaming

WebSocket commands emit NDJSON (one JSON object per line):

```bash
kraken ws ticker BTC/USD -o json | while read -r line; do
  echo "$line" | jq -r '.data[0].last'
done
```

## Error Handling

Route on the `error` field, not on message strings.

| Category | Retryable | Agent action |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `api` | No | Fix parameters. Do not retry same request. |
| `auth` | No | Re-authenticate. Check KRAKEN_API_KEY and KRAKEN_API_SECRET. |
| `network` | Yes | Exponential backoff, max 5 retries, starting at 1s. |
| `rate_limit` | Yes | Wait 5-15s then retry. Reduce request frequency. |
| `validation` | No | Fix input. Check types, required fields, allowed values. |
| `config` | No | Check config file or environment variables. |
| `websocket` | Yes | Reconnect with exponential backoff. CLI retries 3x internally. |
| `io` | No | Check file paths and permissions. |
| `parse` | No | Log raw response. Possible API maintenance. |

### Error handling pattern

```bash
RESULT=$(kraken balance -o json 2>/dev/null)
EXIT=$?

if [ $EXIT -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "$RESULT" | jq .
else
  CATEGORY=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.error // "unknown"')
  case "$CATEGORY" in
    auth)       echo "Re-authenticate" ;;
    rate_limit) sleep 10; echo "Retry" ;;
    network)    sleep 5; echo "Retry" ;;
    *)          echo "Failed: $CATEGORY" ;;
  esac
fi
```

For the full error catalog with backoff strategies and example envelopes, see `agents/error-catalog.json`.

## Rate Limiting

Kraken uses two independent rate limiting systems.

### Spot API

Counter-based with decay. Each endpoint has a cost. The counter decays over time.

| Tier | Max counter | Decay rate |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Starter | 15 | 0.33/s |
| Intermediate | 20 | 0.5/s |
| Pro | 20 | 1.0/s |

Order operations cost more (0-2 depending on operation). Market data costs 1.

### Futures API

Token bucket. Refills at a fixed rate. Each request consumes one token.

### Agent recommendations

- Poll no faster than every 3 seconds for Starter tier.
- Batch order operations where possible (up to 15 per batch).
- Use WebSocket streaming instead of polling for real-time data.
- If you get a `rate_limit` error, wait 5-15 seconds before retrying.

## Paper Trading

Paper trading provides a safe sandbox for testing. No API keys, no account, no real money. Uses live Kraken prices.

### Lifecycle

```bash
kraken paper init --balance 10000 -o json   # Create paper account
kraken paper buy BTCUSD 0.01 -o json        # Market buy
kraken paper sell BTCUSD 0.005 --type limit --price 70000 -o json  # Limit sell
kraken paper status -o json                 # Check portfolio
kraken paper orders -o json                 # Check open orders
kraken paper history -o json                # Trade history
kraken paper reset -o json                  # Reset account
```

Paper trading mirrors the live trading interface. Agents can switch between paper and live by changing the command prefix: `kraken paper buy` vs `kraken order buy`.

A 0.26% taker fee is applied to all fills (Kraken Starter tier default). Limit orders fill at the limit price when the live market crosses the order price.

## Command Groups Overview

|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| market | No | 10 | Public market data: ticker, orderbook, OHLC, trades, spreads |
| account | Yes | 18 | Balances, orders, trades, ledgers, positions, export, L3 orderbook |
| trade | Yes | 9 | Order placement, amendment, cancellation |
| funding | Yes | 10 | Deposits, withdrawals, wallet transfers |
| earn | Yes | 6 | Staking strategies, allocations |
| subaccount | Yes | 2 | Create subaccounts, transfer between accounts |
| futures | Mixed | 39 | Futures market data (public) and trading (private) |

| websocket | Mixed | 15 | Spot WebSocket v2 streaming and request/response |
| paper | No | 10 | Paper trading simulation |
| auth | No | 4 | Credential management (set, show, test, reset) |
| utility | No | 2 | Interactive setup and REPL shell |

Total: 134 commands. For the full machine-readable catalog, see `agents/tool-catalog.json`.

`kraken mcp` is a runtime mode that starts an MCP server, not a tool-callable command. It is not included in the catalog.

## Dangerous Commands

The catalog marks 32 commands as `dangerous: true`. These move real money, cancel real orders, or mutate account state. Gate every one with confirmation logic.

The authoritative source is the `dangerous` field in `agents/tool-catalog.json`.

Common dangerous command groups:

| Group | Commands |
|-------|----------|
| Spot orders | `order buy`, `order sell`, `order batch`, `order amend`, `order edit`, `order cancel`, `order cancel-batch`, `order cancel-all`, `order cancel-after` |
| Funding | `withdraw`, `withdrawal cancel`, `wallet-transfer` |
| Earn | `earn allocate`, `earn deallocate` |
| Subaccounts | `subaccount transfer` |
| Futures | `futures order buy/sell`, `futures edit-order`, `futures cancel`, `futures cancel-all`, `futures cancel-after`, `futures batch-order`, `futures transfer`, `futures wallet-transfer`, `futures set-subaccount-status` |
| WebSocket | `ws add-order`, `ws amend-order`, `ws cancel-order`, `ws cancel-all`, `ws cancel-after`, `ws batch-add`, `ws batch-cancel` |

### Agent Autonomy Levels

Traders can give agents increasing levels of control:

| Level | Agent capability | API key scope |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Read-only | Market data and account queries | Query permissions only |
| Paper trading | Strategy testing with live prices | No key needed |
| Supervised | Trades with human confirmation on each order | Trade permissions |
| Autonomous | Trades independently, no human in the loop | Trade permissions |
| Full control | Trades and moves funds | All permissions |

The CLI supports all levels today. The trader controls the boundary by choosing which API key permissions to grant and whether the agent passes `--yes` to skip prompts. See `skills/kraken-autonomy-levels/SKILL.md` for the full progression guide with safeguards at each level.

### Dry-run support

Use `--validate` on order commands to validate without submitting:

```bash
kraken order buy BTCUSD 0.001 --type limit --price 50000 --validate -o json
```

Use paper trading for full lifecycle testing:

```bash
kraken paper buy BTCUSD 0.001 -o json
```

## Integration

### Calling kraken-cli from agent code

```python
import json, subprocess

def call_kraken(command_args: list[str]) -> dict:
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["kraken"] + command_args + ["-o", "json"],
        capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=30
    )
    output = json.loads(result.stdout) if result.stdout.strip() else {}
    if result.returncode != 0:
        return {"error": "subprocess", "exit_code": result.returncode, "response": output}
    return output
```

### Discovering commands

Load `agents/tool-catalog.json` for the full command contract. Each entry includes the command template, parameter schemas, auth requirements, and a `dangerous` flag for safety gating.

```python
import json

with open("agents/tool-catalog.json") as f:
    catalog = json.load(f)

# All 134 commands with full parameter schemas
commands = catalog["commands"]

# Filter to safe read-only commands
safe = [c for c in commands if not c.get("dangerous") and not c.get("auth_required")]
```

### MCP (built-in server)

`kraken-cli` ships a built-in MCP server over stdio. No subprocess wrappers needed.

Security note:
- MCP is intended for local use on systems you control.
- All connected agents operate with the same configured Kraken account privileges.
- Do not expose or share this MCP server on network-accessible hosts.
- Always use `https://` and `wss://` endpoints.
- Current release posture is alpha, run with least-privilege API keys.

```bash
# Default mode: read-only services (market, account, paper)
kraken mcp

# Guarded mode: all services, dangerous calls require acknowledged=true
kraken mcp -s all

# Autonomous mode: all services, no per-call dangerous confirmation
kraken mcp -s all --allow-dangerous

# Start with specific services
kraken mcp -s market,trade,paper
```

Configure your MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kraken": {
      "command": "kraken",
      "args": ["mcp", "-s", "all"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Service groups**: `market`, `account`, `trade`, `funding`, `earn`, `subaccount`, `futures`, `paper`, `auth`, or `all`. Default exposed groups are `market,account,paper`.

**Behavior:**
- Streaming groups (`websocket`, `futures-ws`) are excluded in MCP v1 (REST-only tools).
- `utility` (interactive setup/shell) is not available as an MCP service.
- Dangerous tools are annotated with `destructive_hint: true` and include `[DANGEROUS: requires human confirmation]` in the description.
- In guarded mode (default), dangerous calls must include `acknowledged=true`.
- In autonomous mode (`--allow-dangerous`), the per-call confirmation is disabled.
- `auth set` and `auth reset` are excluded from MCP registration because they rely on secret input or local credential deletion, both unsuitable for MCP's stateless tool-call model. Configure credentials via environment variables or config file instead.
- All tool execution runs with `force=true` (no interactive prompts).
- Tool names follow the pattern `kraken_<command>` with spaces and hyphens converted to underscores (e.g., `kraken_server_time`, `kraken_order_buy`).
- Input schemas are derived from clap argument metadata. Tool descriptions come from clap help text.
- Errors from tool execution are returned as MCP tool-execution errors, not as panics.
